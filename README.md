Obesity is a physical disease that affects every country all over the world. There are serious health risks to being obese and knowing if one is obese is important for one's health. To better understand that question and answer it. An analysis was done on obesity from an obesity dataset. For this analysis  logistic regression is used to predict obesity in individuals. 4 different models are used to investigate this issue. This analysis also investigates the difference in using 80% training and 20% testing models vs 70% training and 30% testing models. The results found that predicting obesity class 3 in all models was extremely accurate. Model 1 had the best f1-score of 0.74 and predictions for all obesity levels. Model 1 needs more work to be able to be in a medical setting.
